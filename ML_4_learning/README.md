# Learning to code and implement ML projects
This folder includes various code files that I created during my journey of learning machine learning.
Working on these files has not only strengthened my foundational knowledge of Python for machine learning but also enhanced my ability to approach and 
implement ML projects with greater nuance and understanding.
